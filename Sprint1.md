**Story 1**
As Max, a young plant lover, I have many plants, but with a busy garden, it can be hard to keep track of all my plants and their needs. I used to struggle with remembering when to plant, when to harvest, and how much to water each one. But now, with Gardening Helper, it's a breeze.

I used to overwater some plants and underwater others, but not anymore. Gardening Helper helps me keep my plants healthy by reminding me when to plant, harvest, and how much to water each one. All I have to do is input the plant type, location, and watering schedule, and the app takes care of the rest! And if I don’t know this info, Gardening Helper fills in the missing information for hundreds of popular garden plants.

Gardening Helper has made my life so much easier and my plants are happier too. I highly recommend it to any fellow plant lovers out there!

I was able to utilize the community created database allowed me to search and store a ton of information so I could keep track of all the information about what I was planting.









**The Issues we planned to address:**
Create a basic landing page.
Create a basic login page with some functionality.
Aggregate all plant information we plan to use, get API keys etc.
Create a backend structure for handling “Garden” requests.

**The Issues we successfully completed:**
Created a landing page with logo and colors.
Created a frontend login field.
Created a backend http server with login handling and storage.
Created a plain text print command interface for “Garden” requests.

**What we didn’t complete and why:**
Didn’t successfully tie the frontend of the login page to the backend, created an extremely basic mocked up login page in addition to the more formal one for testing the login functionality. 
Login storage isn’t totally done, no input validation.
Some plant information has holes in it, and is stored in different methods, csv files APIs, will need to be combined. We also came to the conclusion that even incomplete information is helpful to the user.
